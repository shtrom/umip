Known issues in MIPL 2.0 RC3
----------------------------

If you run into any of the issues below, don't bother reporting them.
We are already aware of them.

General issues
--------------

* There are some limitations to the use of IPsec together with MIPv6
  due to the design of the Linux IPsec implementation.  Read
  README.IPsec for more information.

Home Agent issues
-----------------

* Removal of the Prefix List entry on lifetime expiration does not
  work properly.  When HA stops serving (i.e. stops sending RAs), the
  corresponding entry is not removed from the Prefix List.

Mobile Node issues
------------------

* The MN doesn't always manage to deregister successfully with a CN if
  UseCnBuAck is turned on. This problem should not arise if the option
  is turned off.

* Multihoming support in the Mobile Node is still under development,
  so we don't currently recommend defining more than one Interface in
  the MN configuration file unless you *really* know what you are
  doing.

* The advanced route optimization policies are likewise under
  development, so the MnRoPolicy configuration options might not work
  as expected.

* When a BUL entry for correspondent node expires, entry which holds
  lifetime with negative value is left behind.  This may result in
  sending unnecessary BU to the CN.
