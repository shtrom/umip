.SH NAME
mip6d.conf \- MIPL Mobile IPv6 and NEMO Configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B %etc%/mip6d.conf
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
MIPL Mobile IPv6 and NEMO daemon's configuration file
.P
Below is a list of currently supported configuration options. All
configuration lines are terminated with a semicolon.  Sub-sections are
enclosed in '{' and '}'.  Strings are quoted with double quotes.

Default value is given when available.

Indication of supported dynamic changes on SIGHUP is also provided.

.SH COMMON OPTIONS

The file contains the following common definitions:
.TP
.BR "include " """<pattern>"""

Includes content from other files. Wildcards are supported.

Example: include "/etc/mip6d.conf.d/*.conf"


.TP
.BR "NodeConfig " "CN | HA | MN" ";"

Indicates if the daemon should run in Correspondent Node, Home Agent or
Mobile Node mode.

Default: CN

Change on reloading: No support. Daemon must be restarted.

.TP
.BR "DebugLevel "  number ";"

Indicates the debug level of the daemon.  If the value is greater than
zero, the daemon will not detach from tty (i.e. debug messages will be
printed on the controlling tty).

Default: 0

Change on reloading: Partial support. Cannot detach from tty afterwards.

.TP
.BR "DoRouteOptimizationCN " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if a node should participate in route optimization with a
Mobile Node.

This option is currently ignored. When the daemon is running, the peer
always answers RO requests from other MNs.

.TP
.BR "NonVolatileBindingCache " "boolean" ";"

This option is currently ignored.  Binding cache is always stored in
volatile memory, and is not retained between shutdown and startup.

.SH OPTIONS COMMON TO HOME AGENT AND MOBILE NODE

.TP
These options are used both in the Home Agent and Mobile Node:
.TP
.BR "Interface " "name" ";"
.TP
.nf
.BR "Interface " "name" " {"
.BR "	MnIfPreference " "number" ";"
.BR "	IfType " "CN | HA | MN" ";"
.B }
.fi

Specifies an interface and options associated with it.  If no options
are present, 
.B Interface
can be terminated with semi-colon.  This is used for home agent to
specify which interfaces are used for HA operation.  For the home
agent to function properly, a Router Advertisement daemon (e.g. radvd)
must broadcast advertisements with the Home Agent bit and Home Agent
Information Option set on these interfaces.  This option is also
used by multihomed Mobile Nodes to define which interfaces are used by
it. For MN and CN, it is posible to provide interfaces that are not
already available when the daemon is started. Those will be used when
available.

.B MnIfPreference
sets the interface preference value for an interface in a multi-homed
Mobile Node.  The most preferred intefaces have preference 1, the
second most preferred have 2, etc.  A preference of zero means the
interface will not be used.

Default: 5

.B IfType
overrides the default node behavior for this interface. If a MN doesn't
wish to use this inteface for mobility, or a node doesn't act as HA on
this interface, the interface type should be set to CN.

Default: same as
.B NodeConfig

Change on reloading: partial support. Only new inet6 interfaces will
use the new configuration.


.TP
.BR "UseMnHaIPsec " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the MN-HA MIPv6 signalling should be protected with IPsec.

Default: enabled

Change on reloading: no support.

.TP
.BR "KeyMngMobCapability " "boolean" ";"

If dynamic keying with MIPv6-aware IKE is used, this options should be
enabled.  It turns on the K-bit for binding updates and binding
acknowledgements.

Default: disabled

Change on reloading: supported.

.TP
.nf
.BR "IPsecPolicySet {"
.BR "	HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"
.BR "	HomeAddress " "address/length" ";"
.BR "	IPsecPolicy ..."
.BR "	...
.BR "}"
.fi

.B IPsecPolicySet
is a set of policies to apply for matching packets.  A policy set can
contain multiple
.B HomeAddress
options, but only one
.B HomeAgentAddress
option.  For home agent, home agent address field contains its own
address, and home address fields may contain any number of mobile
nodes for which the same policy applies.

Change on reloading: supported. The sets can be changed, added or removed.
Removing rules for established bindings may have unpredicted effects.

.B IPsecPolicy
has the following format:

.TP
.BR "IPsecPolicy " "type " "UseESP" "number number" ";"

Field 
.B type 
can be one of HomeRegBinding, Mh, MobPfxDisc, ICMP, any, TunnelMh,
TunnelHomeTesting, or TunnelPayload.  The any option protects all
transport mode communication between the MN and HA.  Currently only
the ESP IPsec protocol is supported, but in the future AH and IPComp
might also be available.  The two remaining numeric fields are the
IPsec reqid values, the first one used for MN - HA, the second one for
HA - MN communication.  If just one value is defined, the same reqid
will be used in both directions.  If no reqid is given, reqid will not
be used.

If more that one IPsec transport mode or tunnel mode policy is defined
between the MN and HA in each direction, reqid can be used to provide
an unambiguous one-to-one mapping between IPsec policies and SAs.
Otherwise the policies will just share a common SA.

.SH HOME AGENT SPECIFIC OPTIONS

The following definitions are ignored unless the node is configured as a HA:

.TP
.BR "HaMaxBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node home registrations.

Default: 262140

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.TP
.BR "SendMobPfxAdvs " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether home agent sends Mobile Prefix Advertisements to
mobile nodes in foreign networks.

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.TP
.BR "SendUnsolMobPfxAdvs " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether home agent send unsolicited Mobile Prefix
Advertisements to mobile nodes in foreign networks.

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.TP
.BR "MinMobPfxAdvInterval " "number" ";"

Sets a minimum interval (in seconds) for Mobile Prefix Advertisements.

Default: 600

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new scheduled MPA.

.TP
.BR "MaxMobPfxAdvInterval " "number" ";"

Sets a maximum interval (in seconds) for Mobile Prefix Advertisements.

Default: 86400

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new scheduled MPA.

.TP
.BR "HaAcceptMobRtr enabled | disabled"

Indicates if the HA accepts Mobile Router bindings.

Default: disabled;

Change on reloading: supported.

.TP
.BR "HaServedPrefix " "prefix/length" ";"

Prefix is an IPv6 prefix and length is the prefix length. Defines the whole
aggregated or extended prefix the HA serves. This option is only used for MR
bindings and is only needed if the MRs derive their Home Addresses from their
Mobile Network Prefixes, instead of one of the home link prefixes.

Change on reloading: supported.

.TP
.BR "BindingAclPolicy " "address MNP list " "allow | deny"

Defines if a MN is allowed to register with the HA or not. The home address
of the MN is given in the address field.  The mobile network prefixes
belonging a NEMO Mobile Router are listed in the MNP list. The list can either
be an empty string or a comma separated list of network prefixes
enclosed in braces, for example:
.B "(3ffe:2620:6:3::/64, 3ffe:2620:6:4::/64)"

.TP
.BR "DefaultBindingAclPolicy allow | deny"

Defines the default policy if no matching BindingAclPolicy entry is found for
a MN.

Default: allow

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.SH MOBILE NODE SPECIFIC OPTIONS

The following definitions are ignored unless the node is configured as a MN:

.TP
.BR "MnMaxHaBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node home registrations.

Default: 262140

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.TP
.BR "MnMaxCnBindingLife " "number" ";"

Limits the maximum lifetime (in seconds) for Mobile Node Correspondent
Node registrations.

Default: 420

Change on reloading: Partial support. Only affects new bindings.

.TP
.BR "MnDiscardHaParamProb " "boolean" ";"

Toggles if the Mobile Node should discard ICMPv6 Parameter Problem messages
from its Home Agent.  As the ICMPv6 error messages won't normally be protected
by IPsec, a malicious third party can quite easily impersonate the HA to the
MN.  Having the MN accept these messages therefore leaves it open to Denial
of Service attacks, even though its home registration signalling is protected
by IPsec.

Default: disabled

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "SendMobPfxSols " "boolean" ";"

Controls whether mobile node sends Mobile Prefix Solicitations to the
home network.

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "DoRouteOptimizationMN " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the Mobile Node should initialize route optimization with
Correspondent Nodes.

Default: enabled

Change on reloading: Partial support, deactivation is not supported.

.TP
.BR "MnUseAllInterfaces enabled | disabled"

Indicates if all interfaces should be used for mobility.  The preference
of these interfaces is always 1.  Unless you use dynamically created and
named network interfaces you should normally disable this option and use
.B Interface
options to explicitly list the used interfaces. 

Default: disabled

Change on reloading: Same support as "Interface" directive.

.TP
.BR "MobRtrUseExplicitMode enabled | disabled"

Toggles between explicit or implicit mode home registrations in the MR.

Default: enabled

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "UseCnBuAck " "boolean" ";"

Indicates if the Acknowledge bit should be set in Binding Updates sent to
Corresponent Nodes.

Default: disabled

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "MnRouterProbes " "number" ";"

Indicates how many times the MN should send Neighbor Unreachability
Detection probes to its old router after receiving a Router
Advertisement from a new one.  If the option is set to zero, the MN
will move to the new router straight away.

Default: 0

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "MnRouterProbeTimeout " "decimal" ";"

Indicates how long (in seconds) the MN should wait for a reply during
a access router Neighbor Unreachability Detection probe.  If set, it
overrides any default Neighbor Solicitation Retransmit Timer value
greater than MnRouterProbeTimeout.  For example, if the interface
Retransmit Timer is 1 second, but MnRouterProbeTimeout is just 0.2
seconds, the MN will only wait 0.2 seconds for a Neighbor Advertisement
before proceeding with the handoff.

Default: 0

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.BR "OptimisticHandoff  enabled | disabled"

When a Mobile Node sends a Binding Update to the Home Agent, no Route
Optimized or reverse tunneled traffic is sent until a Binding
Acknowledgement is received. When enabled, this option allows the
Mobile Node to assume that the binding was successful right after the
BU has been sent, and does not wait for a positive acknowledgement
before using RO or reverse tunneling.

Default: disabled;

Change on reloading: Supported.

.TP
.nf
.BR "MnHomeLink " "name " "{"
.BR "	HomeAddress " "address/length MNP list" ";"
.BR "	HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"
.BR "	MnRoPolicy ..."
.BR "	..."
.BR "}"
.fi

Each 
.B MnHomeLink 
definition has a name.  This is the name (enclosed in double quotes)
of the interface used for connecting to the physical home link.  To
set up multiple Home Addresses on the Mobile Node, you need to define
multiple
.B MnHomeLink
structures.  The interface names don't have to be unique in these
definitions.

Change on reloading: No support.
The daemon has to be restarted for the changes in this directive to take effect.

All the home link specific definitions are detailed below:

.TP
.BR "HomeAddress " "address/length MNP list" ";"

Address is an IPv6 address, and length the prefix length of the
address, usually 64.  The MNP list contains the mobile network prefixes
belonging to that particular NEMO Mobile Router. The MNP list is of the
same format as in
.B "BindingAclPolicy."
This option must be included in a home link definition.

.TP
.BR "HomeAgentAddress " "address" ";"

Address is the IPv6 address of the Mobile Node's Home Agent. DHAAD is used
if it is the unspecified address ::.

Default: ::

.TP
.BR "IsMobRtr enabled | disabled"

Defines if the MN is a NEMO MR.

Default: disabled

.TP
The route optimization policies are of the form:

.TP
.BR "MnRoPolicy " "address boolean" ";"

Any number of these policies may be defined. If no policies are defined default
behavior depends on the
.B DoRouteOptimizationMN
option.

The fields for a route optimization policy entry are as follows: 
.B address
defines the Correspondent Node this policy applies to, if left
undefined the uspecified address is used as a wildcard value 
.B boolean
sets route optimization either enabled or disabled for packets
matching this entry.
