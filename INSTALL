1. Make sure you are running a kernel configured and compiled with
   Mobile IPv6 support enabled.  See INSTALL.kernel for more
   information.

2. Run './configure' in the main directory.  You may give any
   additional parameters (e.g. --prefix=/usr, defaults to /usr/local)
   to configure.  See './configure --help' for complete listing.

   Kernel headers are assumed to be found in /usr/include/linux.  If
   these are not the headers from your current kernel, please specify
   alternative include path, e.g.:

	CPPFLAGS='-isystem /usr/src/linux/include' ./configure

3. Run 'make'.  If everything went ok, you should now have mip6d
   compiled.

4. Run 'make install'.  Executables should now be installed and you
   are ready to configure the node for Mobile IPv6.

   Please refer to configuration file manual page mip6d.conf(5) for
   further information on how to configure your node.  Also take a
   look at the example configuration files in the extras directory.

   For comments about IPsec support check README.IPsec.

5. A startup script 

   To automatically start the Mobile IPv6 subsystem, you need to have
   a startup script.  Many distributions have their own style of
   startup scripts.  We try to provide some scripts in the extras
   directory, but we cannot hope to support all possible variations.
   See if your favorite distribution is supported.  If not, you can
   always write your own.  We will be happy to accept contributed
   startup scripts to be included in subsequent releases.

6. Debugging

   To enable virtual terminal for debugging, use --enable-vt with
   configure.  You can dump the contents of binding cache and binding
   update list with it.  Telnet to port 7777 on the localhost.  You
   should get a prompt "mip6d> ".  If needed, the port can be changed
   with daemon option --vt-service=PORT.  Use 'help' to display
   available commands.
